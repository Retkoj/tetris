# Tetris

Tetris game based on setup of this [tic-tact-toe tutorial](https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-ai-python/).


## Setup

- Built and tested using Python 3.11
- The game is setup as a package,  
install in your environment as follows (note the forward slash - `/`):  
  `python -m pip install library/`  
  (Use the `--editable` flag during development)
- Requires only built-in packages, so there is no `requirements.txt`

## Play

In Windows:
- Open cmd
- Go to the `frontend` folder in the project
- Activate the Python environment
- run `python -m console --help` to see all options
- run `python -m console` to play the game
- Move blocks using the arrow keys left, right and down.
